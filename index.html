			<h1>Hi there, I'm Michael Driscoll!</h1>
			<p>I am an Oracle Data Engineer/Systems Designer at USG Corporation and a CS graduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology with a specialization in Machine Learning.
			
			I find myself fascinated with data, and the insights we can learn from it, trends, future predictions, explaining questions people have. I hate to just wonder about something when we can get data and answer it. 
			
			I'm probably best known for my articles on the eBay scalping market in late 2020 and 2021 where I scraped eBay for data on graphics cards, consoles, and CPUs to track how overpriced the hardware became. This was some of the only data avaliable on the market and was picked up by numerous news outlets such as Bloomberg, PC World, PC Magazine, and others. All the articles I wrote can be found on my dev.to blog. 
			
			I have been volunteering since I was child where I was in Boy Scouts, becoming an Eagle Scout, and now I serve as the 2nd Vice President of the Chicago Engineers' Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to promoting engineering as a career in Chicago high schools by providing mentorship and nearly 100 scholarships annually.
			
			Outside of my professional interests, I am training for an Ironman for fun, am fascinated with naval military history, and working my way visiting every National Park.</a></p>
